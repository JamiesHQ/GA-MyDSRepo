    "## About Libraries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project. Once a library is imported, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn’t load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to add an import statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`. An example of importing the pandas library using the common nickname pd is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## matplotlib and other plotting libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib is the most widely used Python library for plotting.  We can run it in the notebook using the magic command `%matplotlib inline`.  See [the docs](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/plotting.html) for other options to pass to the magic command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will only use matplotlib and seaborn, another package that works in tandem with matplotlib to make nice graphics.  There are a whole range of graphics packages in Python, ranging from basic visualizations to fancy, interactive graphics like [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to explore on your own!  Chances are, if you can imagine a plot you'd like to make, somebody else has written a package to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Pandas Library\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the Python Data Analysis Library (a.k.a. Pandas). The Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with matplotlib and integrates nicely with other libraries that use NumPy (which is another Python library) arrays."

Instead, you will see the first and last few rows with dots in between.  A neater way to view a preview of the dataset is the `head()` method.  Calling `dataset.head()` will displace the first 5 rows of the data.  You can specify how many rows you want to see as an argument, like `dataset.head(10)`.  The `tail()` method does the same with the last rows of the dataframe."
